Fabulary is a digital storytelling platform built with a modern microservices architecture.  
It offers an immersive environment for creating, listing, and reading stories — featuring a gothic-magical aesthetic and seamless integration between a Spring Boot backend and an Angular frontend.

## Overview

The project is being developed as a personal laboratory to explore:

- Microservices with Spring Boot (Java)
- Asynchronous communication using Kafka
- Authentication via JWT
- Angular frontend with a custom theme (two visual modes: **Frame mode** and **Table mode**)
